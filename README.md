**THIS IS A WIP REPO, NOTHING EXCITING IS IN HERE YET.**

This is a repository of custom scanners, exploits, post exploit scripts, and payloads.

**Installation**

On a Kali linux box just download (or clone) this repo and rename the 'msf' directory to '.msf4' and put it in your home directory. Then within 'msfconsole' do reload_all and your module should appear.

**NOTE**
If your module does not appear that means you most likely have a syntax error. Metasploit will not throw errors, but instead fail silently.

For more information about custom modules see the [Rapid7 guide](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Loading-External-Modules)
