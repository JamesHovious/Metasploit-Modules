This is a repository of custom scanners, exploits, post exploit scripts, and payloads.

Initially I'll populate it with 'test' code that that you can use them as templates to build your own custom modules.

Check back often, or 'watch' this repo, as I'll be adding new custom modules often.

**Installation**

On a Kali linux box just download (or clone) this repo and rename the 'msf' directory to '.msf' and put it in your home directory. Then within 'msfconsole' do reload_all and your module should appear.

**NOTE**
If your module does not appear that means you most likely have a syntax error. Metasploit will not throw errors, but instead fail silently.

For more information about custom modules see the [Rapid7 guide](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Loading-External-Modules)
